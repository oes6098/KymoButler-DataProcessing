# KymoButler-DataProcessing
 Batch data processing script to extract and compile different metrics from KymoButler output files

1. Export results from KymoButler
2. Choose desired metric (Start2end velocity, frame2frame velocity, track duration, or track total displacement) and run corresponding script, assumes all KymoButler results files are .xls or .xlsx files and in the same directory, (alternatively can run AllAnalysisCombined.ipynb which will extract all possible metrics at once)
3. Compiles certain metrics per direction (anterograde, retrograde, stationary, and all directions) and outputs excel files with the compiled data in the same directory

KymoButer is an automated kymograph analysis software. This script is to help expedite data processing of the output files generated by KymoButler. For more information, check out their GitHub: https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/KymoButler
