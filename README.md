# KymoButler-DataProcessing
 Batch data processing script to extract and compile different metrics from KymoButler output files

1. Export results from KymoButler (https://github.com/MaxJakobs/KymoButler), which is an excel file with several metrics per track (direction, frame2frame velocity, track duration, track displacement, start2end velocity)
2. Run ExtractDirectionalKymoData.ipy, select desired directory that contains all your KymoButler output files, script will create new folder in directory (kymoresults), then run through each file, and extract all possible metrics by direction (Ex. anterograde frame2frame velocity) and save them on excel files within kymoresults folder. (To extract and compile data across multiple folders at once [i.e. multiple replicates of data or several experimental conditions], run ExtractDirectionalKymoDataMultConditions.ipy, which assumes you have multiple folders in a directory, and within those folders are several KymoButler output files)
3. For basic data analysis on these metrics, run KymoButler-StatisticalAnalysis (https://github.com/oes6098/KymoButler-StatisticalAnalysis) next

KymoButer is an automated kymograph analysis software created by Max Jakobs. This script is to help expedite data processing of the output files generated by KymoButler, but does not change anything in KymoButler itself.
